=head1 NAME

DateTimeX::Start - Find the time at which a day starts.


=head1 VERSION

Version 1.3.0


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use DateTimeX::Start qw( :ALL );

    my $dt = start_of_date([2013, 10, 20], 'America/Sao_Paulo');
    print("$dt\n");  # 2013-10-20T01:00:00
    $dt->subtract( seconds => 1 );
    print("$dt\n");  # 2013-10-19T23:59:59

    # These three are equivalent.
    my $dt = start_of_today();
    my $dt = start_of_today('local');
    my $dt = start_of_date( DateTime->now( time_zone => 'local' ) );

    # These three are equivalent.
    my $dt = start_of_date([2014, 1, 1]);
    my $dt = start_of_date([2014, 1]);
    my $dt = start_of_date([2014]);

    my $dt = start_of_date(  DateTime->now( time_zone => 'local' ) );
    my $dt = start_of_month( DateTime->now( time_zone => 'local' ) );
    my $dt = start_of_year(  DateTime->now( time_zone => 'local' ) );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

In Sao Paulo, in the night of Oct 19th, 2013, the clocks went from 23:59:59 to 01:00:00.
That's just one example of the fact that not all days have a midnight hour.
This module provides a mean of determining when a particular day (or month or year) starts.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 start_of_date / date

    my $dt = start_of_date($date);
    my $dt = start_of_date($date, $tz_or_tz_name);
    my $dt = date($date);
    my $dt = date($date, $tz_or_tz_name);

Returns a DateTime object representing the earliest time of the specified date.

C<$date> must be one of the following:

=over 4

=item * A DateTime object (to find the first time of C<< $date->strftime('%Y-%m-%d') >>),

=item * A reference to an array containing a year, a month and a day (C<[$y,$m,$d]>, to find the first time of the specified date),

=item * A reference to an array containing a year and month (C<[$y,$m]>, to find the first time of the specified month), or

=item * A reference to an array containing a year (C<[$y]>, to find the first time of the specified year).

=back

C<$tz_or_tz_name> must be either a time zone name supported by DateTime::TimeZone or a DateTime::TimeZone object.
It defaults to C<< $dt->time_zone >> if C<$date> is a DateTime object, and C<'local'> otherwise.


=head2 start_of_month / month

    my $dt = start_of_month($date);
    my $dt = start_of_month($date, $tz_or_tz_name);
    my $dt = month($date);
    my $dt = month($date, $tz_or_tz_name);

Returns a DateTime object representing the earliest time of the specified month.

C<$date> must be one of the following:

=over 4

=item * A DateTime object (to find the first time of the month given by C<< $date->strftime('%Y-%m') >>),

=item * A reference to an array containing a year and month (C<[$y,$m]>, to find the first time of the specified month), or

=item * A reference to an array containing a year (C<[$y]>, to find the first time of the specified year).

=back

C<$tz_or_tz_name> must be either a time zone name supported by DateTime::TimeZone or a DateTime::TimeZone object.
It defaults to C<< $dt->time_zone >> if C<$date> is a DateTime object, and C<'local'> otherwise.


=head2 start_of_year / year

   my $dt = start_of_year($date);
   my $dt = start_of_year($date, $tz_or_tz_name);
   my $dt = year($date);
   my $dt = year($date, $tz_or_tz_name);

Returns a DateTime object representing the earliest time of the specified year.

C<$date> must be one of the following:

=over 4

=item * A DateTime object (to find the first time of the month given by C<< $date->year >>), or

=item * A reference to an array containing a year (C<[$y]>, to find the first time of the specified year).

=back

C<$tz_or_tz_name> must be either a time zone name supported by DateTime::TimeZone or a DateTime::TimeZone object.
It defaults to C<< $dt->time_zone >> if C<$date> is a DateTime object, and C<'local'> otherwise.


=head2 start_of_today / today

   my $dt = start_of_today();
   my $dt = start_of_today($tz_or_tz_name);
   my $dt = today();
   my $dt = today($tz_or_tz_name);

Returns a DateTime object representing the earliest time of the current day.

C<$tz_or_tz_name> must be either a time zone name supported by DateTime::TimeZone or a DateTime::TimeZone object.
It defaults to C<'local'>.


=head1 EXPORTS

Nothing is exported by default. The following are exported on demand:

=over 4

=item * C<start_of_date>

=item * C<start_of_month>

=item * C<start_of_year>

=item * C<start_of_today>

=item * C<date>

=item * C<month>

=item * C<year>

=item * C<today>

=item * C<:ALL>

For all of the above.

=item * C<:long>

For C<start_of_date>, C<start_of_month>, C<start_of_year> and C<start_of_today>.

=item * C<:short>

For C<date>, C<month>, C<year> and C<today>.

=back


=head1 ASSUMPTIONS

The code makes the following assumptions about time zones:

=over 4

=item * There is no dt to which one can add time to obtain a dt with an earlier date.

=item * In no time zone does a date starts more than 24*60*60 seconds before the same date starts in UTC.

=item * In no time zone does a date starts more than 24*60*60 seconds after the same date starts in UTC.

=item * There is no year without a January.

=item * There is no month without a 1st.

=item * Jumps in time zones only occur on times with zero seconds. (Optimization)
